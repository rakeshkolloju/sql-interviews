Absolutely! Here are several similar problems that involve finding patterns or sequences within datasets using SQL and window functions. These problems can help you practice using CTEs, window functions, and analytic queries to detect patterns in time-series data or continuous sequences.

Problem 1: Detecting Continuous Price Increases
You are given a dataset of stock prices. Write a query to find the longest continuous sequence where the price of the stock increases day after day.

Input Data:

date	stock_price
2024-01-01	100
2024-01-02	101
2024-01-03	102
2024-01-04	100
2024-01-05	105
2024-01-06	106
2024-01-07	104
Expected Output:

date	stock_price
2024-01-05	105
2024-01-06	106
Approach: Detect where the price decreases, then group rows based on continuous increases.

Problem 2: Finding Maximum Consecutive Attendance
You are given a dataset of student attendance records. Write a query to find the longest streak of consecutive days a student was present.

Input Data:

student_id	date	attendance
1	2024-01-01	Present
1	2024-01-02	Absent
1	2024-01-03	Present
1	2024-01-04	Present
1	2024-01-05	Absent
1	2024-01-06	Present
1	2024-01-07	Present
Expected Output:

date	attendance
2024-01-06	Present
2024-01-07	Present
Approach: Track where "Absent" breaks a streak and find the longest streak of continuous "Present" days.

Problem 3: Longest Consecutive Sales Above Target
You are given a dataset of daily sales data for a company. Write a query to find the longest streak of consecutive days where sales were above the target amount.

Input Data:

date	sales	target
2024-01-01	500	450
2024-01-02	400	450
2024-01-03	600	450
2024-01-04	650	450
2024-01-05	450	450
2024-01-06	700	450
2024-01-07	300	450
Expected Output:

date	sales
2024-01-03	600
2024-01-04	650
Approach: Detect when sales fall below the target, and group continuous sequences of sales above the target.

Problem 4: Identifying Longest Stable Temperature Period
You are given a dataset of daily temperatures. Write a query to find the longest period during which the temperature did not change (i.e., the longest period with the same temperature).

Input Data:

date	temperature
2024-01-01	70
2024-01-02	70
2024-01-03	71
2024-01-04	71
2024-01-05	70
2024-01-06	70
2024-01-07	70
Expected Output:

date	temperature
2024-01-05	70
2024-01-06	70
2024-01-07	70
Approach: Group by consecutive rows with the same temperature value and find the longest period.

Problem 5: Maximum Consecutive Production Days
You are given a dataset representing daily production quantities at a factory. Write a query to find the longest streak of consecutive days where production was non-zero (i.e., where the factory was producing).

Input Data:

date	production
2024-01-01	100
2024-01-02	0
2024-01-03	150
2024-01-04	200
2024-01-05	0
2024-01-06	300
2024-01-07	400
Expected Output:

date	production
2024-01-06	300
2024-01-07	400
Approach: Detect breaks in production where production = 0 and find the longest streak of non-zero production.

Problem 6: Finding Longest Upward Trend in Stock Prices
You are given a dataset of stock prices. Write a query to find the longest streak where stock prices increased day over day.

Input Data:

date	stock_price
2024-01-01	100
2024-01-02	105
2024-01-03	102
2024-01-04	108
2024-01-05	112
2024-01-06	110
2024-01-07	115
Expected Output:

date	stock_price
2024-01-04	108
2024-01-05	112
Approach: Compare each day’s stock price with the previous day’s price, detect breaks in increasing trends, and find the longest sequence of increasing prices.

Problem 7: Longest Period Above Average Performance
You are given a dataset of daily employee performance scores. Write a query to find the longest streak of consecutive days where the performance score was above the daily average performance.

Input Data:

date	score	avg_score
2024-01-01	90	85
2024-01-02	80	85
2024-01-03	95	85
2024-01-04	100	85
2024-01-05	85	85
2024-01-06	105	85
2024-01-07	75	85
Expected Output:

date	score
2024-01-03	95
2024-01-04	100
Approach: Detect where score >= avg_score and find the longest sequence of consecutive days where performance exceeded the average.

These problems all involve detecting patterns or breaks in sequences, either based on comparisons between rows or between columns. You can solve them using window functions like LAG(), LEAD(), ROW_NUMBER(), and others, combined with CTEs to handle intermediate steps.

Let me know if you need SQL solutions for any of these problems!
